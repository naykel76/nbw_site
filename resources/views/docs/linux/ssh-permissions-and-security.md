## Harden Access

It is generally recommended to add authorized_keys to a specific user rather than the root user. Adding authorized_keys to a regular user account allows that user to log in to the server using SSH without requiring a password. This is a more secure approach because it limits the exposure of the server to potential attacks.

By contrast, giving root access to SSH is not considered good security practice as it can increase the risk of a successful attack on the server. If an attacker were to gain access to the root user account, they would have full control over the system, which could result in serious consequences.

In summary, it is best to create a regular user account with SSH access and add the SSH key to that user's authorized_keys file, rather than allowing root access via SSH.

### Create SSH Key

```bash
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
ls -al ~/.ssh
# generate ssh key
ssh-keygen -b 4096
# view key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

<a id="upload-the-public-key-to-server"></a>
#### Upload the public key to server

```bash
# create directory and set user permissions
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && sudo chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh/
# copy key from local computer
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub example_user@203.0.113.10:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Disable Root Access and Password Access

```bash
# disable passwords in sshd_config
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# update to
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
# restart ssh service
sudo service sshd restart
```
