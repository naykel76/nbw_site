## 1. Define the Contract (Interface)

First, define the contract by creating an interface that defines the methods that a class must
implement. This interface will serve as a blueprint for the class that will provide the
functionality.

```php
// app/Contracts/CartInterface.php
namespace App\Contracts;

interface CartInterface {
    public function add(int $id, int $qty): void;
    public function remove(int $id): void;
    public function clear(): void;
}
```

```html +parse
<x-alert type="info">
By defining an interface, you can ensure that any class implementing it adheres to a specific
contract, promoting consistency and modularity in your codebase.
</x-alert>
```

## 2. Create Service Class (Concrete Implementation)

Next, create a concrete class that implements the contract interface. This class will provide the
actual implementation for the methods declared in the contract. Place these classes in an
appropriate directory, such as `app/Services`.

```php
// app/Services/CartService.php
namespace App\Services;

use App\Contracts\CartInterface;

class CartService implements CartInterface
{
    public function add(int $id, int $qty): void
    {
        // Implementation to add an item to the cart
    }

    public function remove(int $id): void
    {
        // Implementation to remove an item from the cart
    }

    public function clear(): void
    {
        // Implementation to clear the cart
    }
}
```

## 3. Bind the Contract to the Concrete Implementation

To use a contract, you need to bind it to a specific concrete class in the Laravel service
container. This tells Laravel which class to use when resolving the interface.

You can do this in the `AppServiceProvider`. Open `AppServiceProvider.php` and add the binding in
the `register` method.

```html +parse
<x-alert type="info">
Laravel's service container allows you to bind an interface to a given implementation. For example,
you can bind the <code>CartInterface</code> to the <code>CartService</code> class, enabling you to
use the interface in your controller without worrying about the underlying implementation.
<a href="https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/container#binding-interfaces-to-implementations"
target="blank">Laravel Docs</a>
</x-alert>
```

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use App\Contracts\CartInterface;
use App\Services\CartService;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
    public function register() {
        // Bind the interface as a singleton to the service
        $this->app->bind(CartInterface::class, CartService::class);
    }
}
```

In this example, we bind the `CartInterface` to the `CartService` class using the `singleton` method.
This means that Laravel will only create a single instance of the `CartService` class and share it
across the application whenever the `CartInterface` is requested.

```html +parse
<x-alert type="info">
By registering the `CartService` as a singleton, means that all parts of your application will share the same cart instance.
</x-alert>
```

The interface is now bound to the concrete implementation, and you can use the interface in your code
without worrying about the underlying implementation. 

## Use the interface in your controller

Now, you can use the contract in your controllers, services, or other parts of your application.
Laravelâ€™s dependency injection container will automatically resolve the appropriate concrete class
when you type-hint the contract interface:


There are several ways to use the interface in your controller.

### Inject the interface directly into the controller's constructor

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/CartController.php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Contracts\CartInterface;

class CartController extends Controller {

    public function __construct(protected CartInterface $cart) { }

    public function add(int $id, int $qty) {
        $this->cart->add($id, $qty);
    }

    public function remove(int $id) {
        $this->cart->remove($id);
    }

    public function clearCart() {
        $this->cart->clear();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CartController` class injects the `CartInterface` into its constructor. Laravel
will automatically resolve the interface and provide an instance of the `CartService` class, which
implements the interface.

### Use a facade to access the underlying implementation

Creating a facade is another way to make the singleton instance of `CartService` globally accessible.
This approach can be useful when you need to access the cart functionality from anywhere in your
application without having to inject the interface manually.

```php
// app/Facades/CartFacade.php
namespace App\Facades;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade;

class CartFacade extends Facade {
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor() {
        return 'cart';
    }
}
```

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
namespace App\Providers;

use App\Contracts\CartInterface;
use App\Services\CartService;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->singleton('cart', function ($app) {
            return $app->make(CartService::class);
        });
    }
}
```


### Create a helper function to access the underlying implementation

Creating a helper function instead of a facade is another way to make the singleton instance of
`CartService` globally accessible. This approach can be simpler and more straightforward for some
use cases.

```php
// app\Helpers\CartHelper.php
namespace App\Helpers;

use App\Contracts\CartInterface;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;

function cart(): CartInterface {
    // Resolve the CartInterface from the service container
    return App::make(CartInterface::class);
}
```
