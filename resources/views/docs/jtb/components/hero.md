<p class="lead">Hero section with background image and text overlay.</p>

## Things To Know
- When adding a background image with css the height must be specified or can be left blank to grow to the content.

<p class="txt-red"> ???? The background image url must be correct or there will be compile errors. For this reason JTB hero class will not have the url and it should be included in the app.scss ???? </p>

When using css to add the background-image, there are no special requirements to place text inside the hero section

 as the background is simply a wrapper with an image background


add the hero-text class for more styling control

    <h1 class="hero-title">Main Headline</h1>
    <h2 class="hero-subtitle">Make it happen.</h2>
    <h2 class="hero-description">Capture your audience with some super exciting, catchy word play.</h2>
