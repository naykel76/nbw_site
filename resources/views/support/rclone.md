## Copy single file from remote to local

All examples below copy **from remote to local**. To copy the other way, just swap the paths.

```powershell +torchlight-powershell
# This copies a single file from remote to local, even though the command is 'copyto'.
rclone copyto $srcRemotePath $destLocalPath
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note: `onedrive:` is the remote name configured in `rclone config`.
> If your remote is named differently, replace `onedrive:` with your own remote name.

Setting the local and remote path variables:

> Mixed slashes are fine â€” PowerShell and rclone handle them fine.

```powershell +torchlight-powershell
$basePath = 'Documents/Studio One/Sound Sets'
$filename = 'Studio One Musicloops.soundset'
$destLocalPath = "C:\Users\natha\OneDrive\$basePath\$filename"
$srcRemotePath = "onedrive:/$basePath/$filename"

rclone copyto $srcRemotePath $destLocalPath --progress
```

## Copy multiple (selected) files from remote to local (by name)

```powershell +torchlight-powershell
$basePath = 'Documents/Studio One/Sound Sets'
$destDir = "C:\Users\natha\OneDrive\$basePath"
$srcDir = "onedrive:/$basePath"

$filename1 = 'Studio One Musicloops.soundset'
$filename2= 'Studio One Instruments Vol 1.soundset'

# Copy multiple files by specifying their names in braces (comma-separated)
rclone copy $srcDir $destDir --include "{$filename1,$filename2}" --progress
```

### Additional Examples 

```powershell +torchlight-powershell
# Alternatively, add multiple --include flags for each file
rclone copy $srcDir $destDir --include $filename1 --include $filename2 --progress
```

```powershell +torchlight-powershell
$basePath = 'Documents/Studio One/Sound Sets'
$destDir = "C:\Users\natha\OneDrive\$basePath"
$srcDir = "onedrive:/$basePath"

$filenames = @(
    'Studio One Musicloops.soundset',
    'Studio One Instruments Vol 1.soundset',
    'Hammer of the Gods.soundset'
)

foreach ($filename in $filenames) {
    rclone copyto "$srcDir/$filename" "$destDir\$filename" --progress
}
```
