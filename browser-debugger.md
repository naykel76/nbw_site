In the Chrome debugger (or any debugger with similar features), "step over," "step into," "step out," and "step" are debugging actions that help you navigate through your code during debugging sessions. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Step Over** (F10 or "Next" button):
   - When you click "Step Over" or press F10 in the debugger, it advances the debugger execution by executing the current line of code.
   - If the current line contains a function call, it will execute the entire function and then stop at the next line after the function call.
   - It is useful for quickly moving to the next line of code without diving into the details of function calls.

2. **Step Into** (F11 or "Step Into" button):
   - "Step Into" allows you to enter the execution of a function call on the current line.
   - If the current line contains a function call, clicking "Step Into" or pressing F11 will take you inside that function and pause at the first line of that function.
   - This is useful when you want to debug the internal workings of a function.

3. **Step Out** (Shift + F11 or "Step Out" button):
   - "Step Out" is used to quickly exit the current function and continue execution until the function call returns.
   - If you're inside a function and want to return to the caller without stepping through every line of the function, you can use "Step Out."
   - It is handy when you've stepped into a function and want to return to the caller context.

4. **Step** (F8 or "Resume" button):
   - "Step" allows you to continue execution until the next breakpoint or until the program completes.
   - It skips over lines of code without diving into function calls.
   - This is useful for quickly progressing through code until you reach a point of interest.

In summary:

- "Step Over" moves to the next line of code, including function calls.
- "Step Into" enters a function call for detailed debugging.
- "Step Out" exits the current function and returns to the caller.
- "Step" continues execution until the next breakpoint or program completion.

Choosing the appropriate action depends on your debugging needs. If you want to understand what's happening inside a function, use "Step Into." If you're interested in the broader flow of your program, use "Step Over" or "Step." "Step Out" is handy when you're deep inside a function but want to return to the caller context.
