You can trigger Alpine.js functionality in response to server-side events by using JavaScript to
emit a custom browser event when the page loads after a server-side action has taken place.

Here's how you can "emit" an event from a Laravel controller and handle it with Alpine.js:

First, in your Laravel controller, after you perform the action that would trigger the
notification, you can return a view with a specific variable that indicates the event occurred.

```php +torchlight-php
public function someAction(){
    // Redirect back with a session flash message
    return redirect()->back()->with('notification', 'Action was successful!');
}
```

Then, in your Blade view, you can check for the presence of that session variable and use inline
JavaScript to dispatch a custom event that Alpine.js can listen for:

```html
@if(session('notification'))
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            // Create the event
            const event = new CustomEvent('notify', {
                detail: {
                    type: 'success',
                    message: '{{ session('notification') }}'
                }
            });

            // Dispatch the event
            window.dispatchEvent(event);
        });
    </script>
@endif
```

Finally, in your Alpine.js component, you can listen for this custom event and react accordingly:

```html
<div x-data="{ open: false, message: '' }" @notify.window="open = true; message = $event.detail.message;">
    <!-- Trigger Button (hidden, since we're triggering from the event) -->

    <!-- Popup Notification -->
    <div
        x-show="open"
        @click.away="open = false"
        x-transition:enter="transition ease-out duration-300"
        x-transition:enter-start="opacity-0 transform scale-90"
        x-transition:enter-end="opacity-100 transform scale-100"
        x-transition:leave="transition ease-in duration-300"
        x-transition:leave-start="opacity-100 transform scale-100"
        x-transition:leave-end="opacity-0 transform scale-90"
        class="fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center p-4">

        <!-- Notification Content -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg">Notification</h2>
            <p x-text="message"></p>
            <button @click="open = false">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

In this example, when the custom `notify` event is dispatched, the Alpine.js component listens for
it with `@notify.window`. It then sets the `open` property to `true` to show the popup and assigns
the message from the event detail to the `message` property, which is displayed in the popup.

This approach allows you to indirectly "emit" an event from a Laravel controller and handle it
with Alpine.js on the front end.
