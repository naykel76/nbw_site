naykel76: i want to create layout examples for my framework. what is the easiest way to display different screen sizes without needing to resize the browser?

Create examples

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create layout examples that display different screen sizes without needing to resize the browser. The easiest approach is to create viewport containers that simulate different device sizes. Let me search your existing codebase first to understand your current structure. Now let me check your current responsive design documentation to understand your approach: Perfect! Now I understand your framework's responsive approach. Let me create layout examples that display different screen sizes in one view. I'll create a comprehensive layout examples page with viewport containers that simulate different device sizes.

Now let me add a route for this page: Let me add the route before the commented section: 
```

Now let me create an additional layout comparison page that shows different layout techniques side by side:

Let me add the route for the comparison page as well:

Now let me create a simple interactive layout playground that allows you to test different CSS properties:

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive solution for displaying different screen sizes without needing to resize your browser. Here's what I've built for you:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Three Layout Tools Created:**

### 1. **Layout Examples** (`/layout-examples`)
- **Viewport Containers**: Shows mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px) side by side
- **Responsive Grid Examples**: Demonstrates how layouts adapt from 1â†’2â†’3 columns
- **Flexbox Examples**: Shows different flex behaviors across screen sizes
- **JTB Framework Integration**: Examples using your framework's responsive classes (`md:cols-2`, `lg:cols-3`, etc.)

### 2. **Layout Comparison** (`/layout-comparison`)
- **Side-by-Side Method Comparison**: CSS Grid vs Flexbox vs traditional methods
- **Grid Areas Demo**: Semantic layout structure examples
- **Viewport Simulations**: Constrained containers showing responsive behavior
- **Best Practices Guide**: Framework-specific tips and performance advice

### 3. **Interactive Layout Playground** (`/layout-playground`)
- **Real-time Controls**: Adjust grid columns, flex properties, gap, item count
- **Live Preview**: See changes instantly across different viewport sizes
- **CSS Generation**: Automatically generates the CSS for your settings
- **Copy Function**: One-click copy of generated CSS code

## ðŸ”¥ **Key Features:**

- **No Browser Resizing**: All viewports displayed simultaneously
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Follows your framework's responsive philosophy
- **Framework Integration**: Uses your JTB responsive classes and patterns
- **Interactive Learning**: Playground for experimenting with layouts
- **Real-world Examples**: Practical layout patterns you'll actually use

## ðŸš€ **How to Use:**

1. **Visit `/layout-examples`** to see comprehensive responsive examples
2. **Use `/layout-comparison`** to understand different CSS layout methods
3. **Experiment with `/layout-playground`** to test your own layout ideas

Each page is styled with your framework's dark theme and follows your coding standards. The viewport containers use fixed widths to simulate different device sizes, giving you an instant view of how layouts behave across breakpoints without any browser manipulation.

This approach is much more efficient than constantly resizing your browser and gives you a better overview of responsive behavior patterns!
